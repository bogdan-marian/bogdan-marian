# 👋 Hi, I’m Bogdan Marian Oloeriu

I'm a senior software architect with over 20 years of experience building robust, secure, and maintainable systems — from NATO command-and-control platforms to modern cloud services in the private sector.

Currently based in Ghent, Belgium 🇧🇪, I specialize in backend architecture, secure data processing, and designing loosely coupled cloud systems — whether monolithic, modular, or microservices done right.
